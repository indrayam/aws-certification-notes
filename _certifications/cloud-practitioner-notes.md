  + Choosing a Region
    - Available Services and Features
    - Cost of Services
    - Latency, Proximity to Users
    - Disaster Recovery
    - Security & Compliance
  + Availability Zones:
    - Each AZ is at least one, sometimes 2 or more, DCs very close to each other
    - AZs are connected with private fiber
  + Edge Locations
    - These locations power AWS CDN (CloudFront) and DNS (Route53) services
- Networking using VPC
  + Logically isolated network. It cannot connect to other VPC or outside world without configuration
  + Created per account, per Region
  + Embrace the idea of multiple VPCs for your App Architecture
  + One VPC spans one single Region. Translation: One VPC can use "all" AZs within one Region
  + VPCs can peer with one another. However, in order for that to happen, the CIDR block for the two VPCs trying to peer should not have overlapping IP addresses
  + VPCs allow us to create Internet and VPN Gateways
  + VPCs provide numerous security mechanisms: Security Groups etc.
  + There is a soft limit of 5 VPCs per Region, per Account. However, you can request to have that be increased
- Subnets in VPC
  + Divide VPCs into Subnets
  + Subnets are tied 1:1 with AZs
  + For example, if the VPC CIDR is set to 10.2.0.0/16, by definition it has a total of ~65k addresses it can work (read, subnet) with. If we the region has 3 AZs and we decided to create 3 subnets, one for each AZ, we could create the following subnets:
    - 10.2.0.0/24 can have a maximum of 2^8 - 2 = 254 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.0.0/24
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.0.255/24
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.0.1 to 10.2.0.254
    - 10.2.1.0/24 can have a maximum of 2^8 - 2 = 254 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.1.0/24
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.1.255/24
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.1.1 to 10.2.1.254
    - 10.2.2.0/28 can have a maximum of 2^4 - 2 = 14 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.2.0/28
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.2.15/28
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.2.1 to 10.2.2.14
  + Let's take a Three-Tier Architecture which includes:
    - Public LB Tier
    - Private App Tier
    - Private DB Tier
  + Each tier should have Internet Access, High Availability, Fault Tolerance along with Isolation & Security
  + In such a case, you will end up with potentially 9 unique subnets, 3 for each tier and each tier replicated across 3 AZs
  + For example, if the VPC CIDR is set to 10.2.0.0/16, we could create 9 Subnets, using the following 16 subnets by using /21:
    - 10.2.0.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2046 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.0.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.7.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.0.1 to 10.2.7.254
    - 10.2.8.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2044 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.8.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.15.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.8.1 to 10.2.15.254    
    - 10.2.16.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2044 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.16.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.23.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.16.1 to 10.2.23.254
    - 10.2.24.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2044 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.24.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.31.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.24.1 to 10.2.31.254
    - ...plus 12 more subnets like this
  + Subnets enable
    - Security via Isolation
    - Because subnets allow us to use multiple AZ, it enables High-Availability
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Performance: In order to achieve the lowest latency and best packet per sec performance, all of the machines would need to be in the same subnet in the same AZ. So, sometimes, you may have to compromise on HA for sake of Performance or vice versa
+ Routing & Firewalls
  - In any given VPC, the way traffic flows from it to anywhere else is by way of Routing. In other words, routing is the first line of defense. A firewall of sorts. Why? Because without a route, packets are just not going to flow anywhere. We can whitelist IPs to define where traffic is allowed to flow.
  - If you want hosts in a subnet inside a VPC to talk to the internet, first you create and attach an Internet Gateway (igw-1) to the VPC
  - Then create a Route Table with a definition like the following:
    10.2.0.0/16 => local
    0.0.0.0/0   => igw-1
  - Once you have created a Route Table, you attach the Route Table to the Subnet. By doing this, you enable bi-directional communication to and from the Internet. By doing this, you have technically made the Subnet a "public" subnet. Basically, a subnet is "public" if it has to and from Internet access
  - Network Access Control Lists are firewalls of the subnet as a whole. 
  - Security Groups are firewalls at the individual machine level inside a subnet. Once you define Security Groups and add machines to it, "allow" rules can be created referencing the Security Groups, not the individual VMs per se
  - By default, security groups have an implicit "Deny All" rule. All your rules are really for allowing traffic on ports "explicitly"
- Route53
  + Amazon Route 53 is Amazon's globally distributed DNS service and leverages those 200 odd edge locations. 
  + We can register domains since it is also a Registrar
  + We can use AWS as stable, reliable and fast nameservers, thanks to the edge locations again
  + It supports Public and Private DNS zones
  + Automated via API
  + Supports Health Checks
  + Routing Methods
    - Latency based Routing
    - Geographic Routing
    - Failover Routing, when used in conjunction with Health Checks
    - Weighted Sets
- AWS Hardware VPN
  - Hardware enabled IPSEC encrypted VPN tunnel
  - On the Amazon side, that tunnel is powered by two physically distinct routers in two distinct facilities
  - On the customer side, it should me made HA too by running 2 routers on their side
  - VPN connectivity is really great for admin work, for low bandwidth type of transfer
- Amazon Direct Connect
  - If there is more data to be pumped between AWS VPCs and Customer premise, Amazon Direct Connect might be better
  - Customer works with a AWS Direct Connect Provider and can setup a 1 or 10 GBPS fiber connection to the Provider
  - DX Providers already have connections to AWS
  - This is definitely prefered if you need lots of bandwidth to flow between your premise and AWS
- EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)
  - VMs
  - Linux or Windows
  - Xen or Nitro hypervisor
  - Bare Metal is available
  - Fixed Prices based on CPU, IO, Disk and Memory
  - Default limit is 20 per account
  - Different Billing Models
    + On-demand
    + Spot Instances
    + Reserved Instances
  - Hourly fees includes license cost of operating system
  - Rack, Chassis => Intel Xeon (CPU)/Motherboard => Hypervisor (Xen or Nitro) => EC2 Instances (VM)
  - There may be that more than one tenant on a single host
  - However, a single customer could get dedicated host
  - AMI - Amazon Machine Images
- EC2 Best Practices
  - Treat them as disposable
  - "Immutable Infrastructure"
  - Logs as Streams
  - Leverage Roles that allows us to control access to other AWS services
  - Automate Deployments
  - Monitor with CloudWatch
  - Enable scaling and self-healing with Auto Scaling
- EBS (Elastic Block Store)
  - Increase data durability of an EC2 instance
  - Used when we need higher degree of Random IO
  - Used when we need a mounted filesystem
  - Efficient protocol
  - Can be attached or detached to an EC2 in the same AZ
  - You can create snapshots from an EBS volume which is saved in S3
  - You can copy the snapshot to a different AZ and restore an EBS volume from that
- ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)
  - Distributes requests/traffic 
  - Spans Region, uses every AZ
  - Managed Service which is inherently secure, resilient and scalable
  - Health Check support
  - Integrates with Auto Scaling
  - Integrates with Route53
  - Offloads SSL, Customize Security Policy
  - 3 types of ELB:
    + Classic: Setup Ports to listen on, Register EC2 instance(s) and define which Port on the EC2 instance(s) to forward traffic to
    + Application Load Balancer: Setup Ports to listen on, Create Target Groups and then use Layer7 content filtering rules to route traffic ('/abc') to a specific Target Group. Allows Dynamic Port mapping so that one EC2 instance can receive traffic on different ports. Not possible with Classic LB.
    + Network Load Balancer: Setup Ports to listen on, Create Target Groups and then forward traffic to Ports on the Target Group. Why? Since NLB is a Layer3 Load Balancer. Handles very long running connections (for months) to backend Targets.
