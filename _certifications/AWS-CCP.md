  + Regions: 
    - US West: Oregon, N. California, GovCloud (US-West)

  + Choosing a Region
    - Available Services and Features
    - Cost of Services
    - Latency, Proximity to Users
    - Disaster Recovery
    - Security & Compliance
  + Availability Zones:
    - Each AZ is at least one, sometimes 2 or more, DCs very close to each other
    - AZs are connected with private fiber
  + Edge Locations
    - These locations power AWS CDN (CloudFront) and DNS (Route53) services
- Networking using VPC
  + Logically isolated network. It cannot connect to other VPC or outside world without configuration
  + Created per account, per Region
  + Embrace the idea of multiple VPCs for your App Architecture
  + One VPC spans one single Region. Translation: One VPC can use "all" AZs within one Region
  + VPCs can peer with one another. However, in order for that to happen, the CIDR block for the two VPCs trying to peer should not have overlapping IP addresses
  + VPCs allow us to create Internet and VPN Gateways
  + VPCs provide numerous security mechanisms: Security Groups etc.
  + There is a soft limit of 5 VPCs per Region, per Account. However, you can request to have that be increased
- Subnets in VPC
  + Divide VPCs into Subnets
  + Subnets are tied 1:1 with AZs
  + For example, if the VPC CIDR is set to 10.2.0.0/16, by definition it has a total of ~65k addresses it can work (read, subnet) with. If we the region has 3 AZs and we decided to create 3 subnets, one for each AZ, we could create the following subnets:
    - 10.2.0.0/24 can have a maximum of 2^8 - 2 = 254 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.0.0/24
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.0.255/24
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.0.1 to 10.2.0.254
    - 10.2.1.0/24 can have a maximum of 2^8 - 2 = 254 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.1.0/24
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.1.255/24
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.1.1 to 10.2.1.254
    - 10.2.2.0/28 can have a maximum of 2^4 - 2 = 14 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.2.0/28
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.2.15/28
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.2.1 to 10.2.2.14
  + Let's take a Three-Tier Architecture which includes:
    - Public LB Tier
    - Private App Tier
    - Private DB Tier
  + Each tier should have Internet Access, High Availability, Fault Tolerance along with Isolation & Security
  + In such a case, you will end up with potentially 9 unique subnets, 3 for each tier and each tier replicated across 3 AZs
  + For example, if the VPC CIDR is set to 10.2.0.0/16, we could create 9 Subnets, using the following 16 subnets by using /21:
    - 10.2.0.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2044 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.0.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.7.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.0.1 to 10.2.7.254
    - 10.2.8.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2044 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.8.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.15.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.8.1 to 10.2.15.254    
    - 10.2.16.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2044 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.16.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.23.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.16.1 to 10.2.23.254
    - 10.2.24.0/21 can have a maximum of 2^11 - 2 = 2044 Hosts in the Subnet
      Network IP: 10.2.24.0
      Broadcast IP: 10.2.31.255
      Usable IP Addresses: 10.2.24.1 to 10.2.31.254
    - ...plus 12 more subnets like this
  + Subnets enable
    - Security via Isolation
    - Because subnets allow us to use multiple AZ, it enables High-Availability
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Performance
