Solving this at low cost requires a dedicated inference chip!) 

## Learning to build Modern Apps on AWS

- Deploy Sample Modern Apps on AWS:
  + [GCP Microservices Demo App](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)
  + [Weaveworks Sock Shop](https://microservices-demo.github.io/)
  + [Twitter Voting App](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app)
  + [Scaling Microservices with Message Queues, Spring Boot and Kubernetes](https://medium.com/hackernoon/scaling-microservices-with-message-queues-spring-boot-and-kubernetes-9ba4b0e48bdf)
  + My App (Stocks Rock!):
    - Capabilities:
      + Allow users to create a basket of stocks. 
        - Support Symbol Look, which should make a live call and show latest information about the company

      + Adding and/or Editing is handled using synchronous API call
      + Deleting will trigger Worker via SQS. Worker will use SNS (or SES) to send email asking for confirmation
      + User's selection of stocks as well as Audit trail is stored in Aurora Serverless (MySQL) and/or DynamoDB
      + List view is cached in ElastiCache, with Refresh functionality
    - Microservices: Web App (Fargate or EKS), Web API (Fargate or EKS, API Gateway), Worker (Lambda, API Gateway)
    - DynamoDB, ElastiCache (Redis)
    - SQS, SNS/SES
