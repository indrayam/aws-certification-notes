4. Amazon Polly (Service that turns text into lifelike speech! Lets you create apps that talk!!)
5. Amazon Rekognition (Service that makes it easy to add image analysis to apps)
6. Amazon Translate (Machine Translation service that delivers fast, high-quality, and affordable language translation)
7. Amazon Transcribe (Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) service. Makes it easy for developers to speech-to-text capability to apps)
8. Amazon Textract (Service that automatically extracts data from scanned docs. Goes beyond OCR to read data from form fields and tables)
9. Amazon Forecast (Service that uses machine learning to deliver high quality accurate business forecasts)
10. Amazon Personalize (Service that uses machine learning to help apps create individualized recommendations for their users/customers) 
11. Amazon Deep Learning AMIs (Helps ML practitioners by giving them infra/tools to accelerate deep learning in the cloud)
12. AWS DeepLens (Helps developers get started with Deep Learning)
13. AWS DeepRacer (Helps developers get started with reinforcement learning(RL))
14. Apache MXNet on AWS
15. TensorFlow on AWS
16. Amazon Elastic Inference (Allows you to attach low-cost GPU-powered acceleration to Amazon EC2 and SageMaker instances to reduce cost of running deep learning inference)
17. AWS Inferentia (Machine Learning inference chip designed to deliver high performance at low cost. Making predictions using a trained machine learning model - a process called "inference" - can drive as much as 90% of the compute costs of the app. While Amazon Elastic Inference can reduce costs by up to 75%, some inference workloads require an entire GPU or have extremely low latency requirements. Solving this at low cost requires a dedicated inference chip!) 

### Robotics
1. AWS Robomaker (Service that makes it easy to develop, test and deploy intelligent robotics apps)

### Satellite
1. AWS Ground Station (Fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications, downlink and process satellite data etc.)
